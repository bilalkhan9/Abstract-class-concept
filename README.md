#Description
In object-oriented programming, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes are designed to be subclassed, serving as a template for concrete classes to implement their own functionality.

#Purpose
The main purpose of an abstract class is to define a common interface for a group of related classes. It allows you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring consistency and providing a structure for polymorphism.

#Usage
To create an abstract class in C++, you use the virtual keyword to declare one or more methods as pure virtual functions. A pure virtual function is a function that has no implementation in the base class and must be implemented by derived classes.
